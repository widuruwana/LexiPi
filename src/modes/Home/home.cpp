    Few words from the developer:

    For all the years I had to tolerate living I managed to never cross paths with a single crossword game other
    than the puzzels I saw in my favorite newspaper back in the day. It was called "Wijaya", and if you were to collect
    all those rare educational and actually worth while social media reels and pile it up to a 25ish amount of papers
    and ship one out every single week that would basically be that newspaper. But I was too lazy to actually fill it
    up, partially because it was in Sinhala, a language that would be a nightmare for a native english speaker to learn
    to write but to be fair the performance of the locals puts our forefathers to shame.

    The game that starts with the letter S (for legal reasons I cannot mention its name) was introduced to me by a
    friend who is happened to be a prime nerd phenotype. I didnt think much of it when I heard its about making silly
    little words to get points. But eventually I understood the complexity of this bag of tiles as I was keep playing.
    When your opponent play some word that is so niche that its only ever used in 5 instances of the entierity of
    english literature, it is less of a frustration and more of a dissapointment towards humanity for not making use
    of a language's absolute potential. But like on the second thought, I consider combo swearing as the peak of word
    saladry (ex: Sybau).

    I still dont think me or any of my peers fully understand all the laws in this game. Two weeks ago when I was
    participating to the freshers scrabble tournement representing my faculty, I had to face the same guy from the
    faculty of medicing (which I beat on first round) and at the middle of the game I was clarified that you swap
    the timer as soon as you begin exchanging, which I was taught the exact oppossite of, and which I taught the two
    other players before this match of. God knows how long they will carry that misinformation. Because I can tell that
    those two do not give two dry f***s about this game to google its rules, from their performance. I mean fair
    enough, I wouldnt either if I were forced to participate just to fill a blank. Also I lost to the medicing dude
    on that round. Now we both have one win per each but I still has net positive margin (which no one cares about, but
    still helps to hide my shame).

    Anyways, I hooked into this game enough to bother my girlfriend into playing this game with me every night and
    my toxic competitive self that was unhealed from my pvp shooter addiction started to emerge back again. She is
    not a person interested in wasting her lifespan and health by screwing up her sleep schedule, so she usually only
    wants to play a single match. But in a case where I lose, my toxicity itches my soul to not to end the night on a
    loss so I starts to bother her again for a rematch and to absolutly no ones suprise she hated me for that.
    The happiness and pride that sparked withing my primitive brain after seeing her improve and become a better player
    apperantly wasnt enough to overshadow that competitivenes. Well as any sane person would do I accepted that flaw
    and did some growing up. And as we played we improved enough to be decent players as both of us had a good mental
    vocabulary from consuming pop cultural elements (two different paths I might add).

    LEXI-PI is not a word that I added just because it rolls out of the tongue nicely. Pi is short for Pisces, which is
    an astrological sign where you can see two fish swimming in opposite directions. I am not a beliver of Zordiac
    signs by any means by the way. The Logo for this program is inspired by this in case you havent already figured out.
    Her name doesnt not have any inherit meaning but the words its derived form has meanings, which would point
    to a fish if you twitch your eyes hard enough. There is my reason.

    LEXI_PI

    A labor of love for my amazing girlfriend.

|  1) A player plays their last tile AND the tile bag is empty.                |
|     - The opponent then gets one chance to PASS or CHALLENGE.                |

|  2) Six consecutive scoreless turns occur (passes or exchanges).             |
|                                                                              |

|    - The player who goes out receives doubles the total point value of       |
